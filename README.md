# wad2024S2 Possible/Suggested Solutions
Solutions to selected labs will be uploaded here for your study and reference.

## Download modules and run your node.js codes
The solutions will not come with the [node_modules] folder. 
Please go to commandline, go to the directory where the codes are downloaded, perform an npm install on your command-line/powershell.
For example, if your code directory is c:\mycodes\lab2, and your running js file is app.js, enter:
```
cd c:\mycodes\lab2
npm install
node app.js or node server.js, depending on your running js file
```
if your drive is not C drive (e.g. d: drive), you need an extra statement before your cd command:
```
d:
cd d:\mycodes\lab2
npm install
node app.js  or node server.js, depending on your running js file
```
